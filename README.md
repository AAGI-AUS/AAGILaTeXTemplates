Use these templates, together with a suitable TeX environment and compiler, to 
prepare your AAGI reports, presentations, and other documents.

- **[AAGI Report](/AAGI%20Report)**: An AAGI-themed template for project 
  reports. Use this template for the 'large' (i.e., project conclusion) reports, such 
  as major milestone reports for Research & Development investments, or analytics
  reports to clients for Service & Support investments.
- **[AAGI Interim Report](/AAGI%20Interim%20Report)**: An AAGI-themed 'small'
  report template, designed for shorter (i.e., 3-4 page) reports. Use this template
  for summary or interim reporting to clients or for investment milestones.
- **[AAGI Document](/AAGI%20Document)**: A general AAGI-themed document template.
  Use this template for miscellaneous documents such as guides, overviews, 
  checklists, media releases, memos, and others.
- **[AAGI Presentation](/)**: AAGI-theming for
  PowerPoint presentation slides. Use this template for presentations showcasing
  your AAGI project work, or when representing the AAGI brand at events.

## Installation & Usage Instructions

TODO. (include optional install of a full TeX environment via texlive. Other than
that, mostly plug-and-play: simply copy over a directory and you should have
everything you need.)

under the AAGI Research & Development investment **AAGI-AU-RD-WOP**, with guidance
